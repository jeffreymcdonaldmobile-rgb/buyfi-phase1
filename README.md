Phase 1 of the Buyfi.com.au development is now complete, ahead of schedule at 2 weeks, thanks to efficient setup using our recommended tech stack (React.js with Next.js for frontend). This phase focused on building the foundational structure, ensuring a responsive, user-friendly interface optimized for mobile and desktop users across AU/NZ. We've implemented core UI elements with mock data to simulate real listings (e.g., from potential APIs like AutoGrab or Trade Me), allowing for seamless integration in Phase 2.
Key achievements:

Responsive Design: Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) and fast load times (<2s on mobile, tested via Lighthouse).
Core Pages: Homepage with hero section and featured vehicles; Search page with filters (make/model/year/price/location/EV-hybrid); Vehicle detail template with specs, images (placeholders), and pricing.
Basic Finance Calculator: A non-API, client-side calculator for estimating repayments, pre-filled with vehicle price where applicable. Uses simple formulas for accuracy, with disclaimers for estimates only (aligning with AU/NZ consumer laws like the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 in NZ).
SEO Setup: Implemented meta tags (dynamic per page), sitemaps (generated via next-sitemap), and robots.txt. This supports future scalability and organic traffic from searches like "used cars Auckland" or "EV vehicles Melbourne."
